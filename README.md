turns piano "tutorial" videos (ones with visual representation of key stokres) into sheet music

why i am making this project:
i wanted to learn a specific piece from the anime "Pluto" but when i searched for the music sheets i was met with paywalls
so i turned to youtube and i found the visualisation videos of someone playing (https://youtu.be/GZmGGFMgD-g?si=3P2mJVngSsVy8Qmy like this one)
and i thought that i can probably turn this into music sheets and that it would be a cool project
